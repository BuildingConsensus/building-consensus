      In mediation, the parties decide the outcome themselves. The focus is on
      cooperation and communication
      <br />
      Mediation can often be scheduled quickly and resolved in hours or days,
      while court cases can drag on for months or even years.
      <br />
      Mediation costs far less than litigation (in legal fees, expert witnesses,
      court costs, etc.).
      <br />
      Mediation is private. What is discussed remains confidential, while court
      cases are public â€” court filings and hearings become public records.

            where a neutral third party, the mediator, 
            helps  disputing parties find a mutually agreeable resolution to their conflict. 
            It's a structured process that allows parties to express their perspectives, explore solutions, 
            and potentially reach a settlement that addresses  their needs."
